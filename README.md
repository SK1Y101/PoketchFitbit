## Pok√©tch.

### Features available

Unlike the original Pok√©tch, which came with 25 applications, my Pok√©tch watch face comes with just 7, which are, in order:

Digital clock        - Shows the time

Pedometer          - Shows your steps

Stats view           - Shows your other stats

Counter               - Manually count something with the press of a button

Analogue Watch  - Shows the time again!

Move Calc  - Shows how effective an attack will be

Calendar              - Want to know the current date?

Timer                   - Count down from up to 99 minutes. (Accuracy may vary)

Tap the bottom half of the screen to cycle through the applications, or tap the top half to cycle backwards.

To enable/disable certain applications, use the dropdown available in the settings for the watch face. By default, only the digital watch face is visible.

### Customisation

Button             - Diamond/Pearl single button, or the Platinum double button

Face colour     - Dark watch face, or the Light watch face

Edge colour     - Diamond blue, Pearl pink, Barry's orange, Platnium blue, or Platinum pink

Screen colour  - Default Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, Violet, Indigo, Blue, and Grey

Mascot         - Want an Eevee, or a Pikachu on your digital clock?

Wherever possible, I have tried to keep the watch feature and aesthetics as close to the original Pok√©tch from the games, with minimal changes.

For further description of watch features, see the wiki pages in the github repo [here](https://github.com/SK1Y101/PoketchFitbit/wiki)
