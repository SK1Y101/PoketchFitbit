# Skiylia

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skiylia-Lang/skiylia-lang.github.com/7a2533a517895c08b8aa52c32396c292a0563d49/Skiylia_Logo_text.svg" width=60%/>

Skiylia is dynamically typed, object oriented, and most importantly *interpreted*. While it may share many similarities with C derivatives, its heritage is definitely Pythonic.

The main directory housing the <This Repo> interpreter is [here](../../tree/main/<This Repo>). Within that directory is a separate document listing the most important syntax for Skiylia.
