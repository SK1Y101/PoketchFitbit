# Skiylia

Skiylia is dynamically typed, object oriented, and most importantly *interpreted*. While it may share many similarities with C derivatives, its heritage is definitely Pythonic.

The main directory housing the <This Repo> interpreter is [here](../../tree/main/<This Repo>). Within that directory is a separate document listing the most important syntax for Skiylia.
